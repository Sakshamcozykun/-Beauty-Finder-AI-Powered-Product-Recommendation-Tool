üåü Beauty Finder: AI-Powered Product Recommendation Tool
Beauty Finder is an intelligent, web-based application designed to help users discover the perfect beauty products tailored to their specific needs. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, this tool analyzes user preferences and product URLs to provide personalized, real-time recommendations from popular Indian beauty brands.

‚ú® Features
AI-Powered Recommendations: Utilizes the Gemini API to understand user queries and deliver smart, relevant product suggestions.

Personalized Filtering: Users can specify their skin type, primary concerns (like acne, aging, or dullness), and desired product category.

URL Analysis: Optionally, users can input product URLs from sites like Nykaa or Mamaearth to give the AI more context for its recommendations.

Dynamic & Interactive UI: A sleek, retro-themed interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that is fully responsive and easy to navigate.

Featured Brands Showcase: A dedicated section to explore and visit the storefronts of popular Indian beauty brands.

User-Friendly Notifications: Provides smooth, intuitive feedback for actions like adding URLs or when input is required.

üöÄ How It Works
The application is built with a simple yet powerful front-end stack and is powered by a generative AI model on the backend.

Frontend: The user interface is crafted with HTML5, styled with modern CSS3 (including custom properties and gradients), and made interactive with vanilla JavaScript. No heavy frameworks are needed, ensuring the app is lightweight and fast.

Backend (AI): When a user requests recommendations, the application securely sends their preferences and query to the Google Gemini API.

Prompt Engineering: A carefully constructed prompt instructs the AI to act as a beauty expert, analyze the user's needs, and return a clean JSON object containing the product recommendations.

Dynamic Rendering: The JavaScript then parses the JSON response and dynamically renders the product cards in the UI, creating a seamless user experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.

(Optional) Add one or more product URLs you're interested in.

Select your skin type, primary concern, and product category from the dropdown menus.

In the text box, describe what you're looking for (e.g., "a hydrating serum for dry skin under ‚Çπ1000").

Click "‚ú® Find My Perfect Products" and watch as the AI generates personalized recommendations for you!
